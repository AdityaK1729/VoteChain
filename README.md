#Before Checkpoint 1-
In the first half mentor gave us some resources to read, namely 
- a blockchain tutorial at- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/blockchain/index.htm
- original bitcoin whitepaper (bitcoin.pdf)
- beginner python tutorial at w3schools
Also he provided a template file of classes we will make when we start with the implementation.
So yeah the first half was pretty much reading part only, so not really any original code is here
